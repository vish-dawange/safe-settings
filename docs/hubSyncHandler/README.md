# Safe Settings Organization Sync & Dashboard

 This feature provides a centralized approach to managing the Safe-Settings Admin Repo, allowing Safe-Settings configurations to be sync'd across multiple ORGs.

## Overview

This adds the **hub‑and‑spoke synchronization capability** to Safe Settings.

One central **master admin repository** (the hub) serves as the authoritative source of configuration ('Master' Admin Config Repo) which is automatically propagated to each organization’s **admin repository** (the spokes).

**Note:** When something changes in the 'Master' repo (the hub), only those changed files are copied to each affected ORG’s admin repo, so everything stays in sync.

#### :warning: In order for `Safe-Settings Hub-Sync` to enforce Policy sync in the controlled ORGs/Repos, **Safe-Settings** needs to be given **Bypass authority** for any branch protection Ruleset that prevents 'direct pushes'.

## Sync Lifecycle (High Level)

```

## Initial Setup

Before getting started with the hub-sync configuration, you'll need to deploy and build the Safe Settings App, including the UI.

### Deploy the Application

To deploy the Safe Settings application to a hosting environment, choose one of the following deployment options:

#### Option 1: Virtual Machine (VM)
Deploy Safe Settings on a VM (AWS EC2, Azure VM, Google Compute Engine, etc.):

1. Set up a VM with Node.js installed
2. Clone the Safe Settings repository to the VM
3. Copy your built UI files to the VM
4. Configure environment variables (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables--inputs-specific-to-the-hub-sync-feature))
5. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

 :warning: Follow the standard GitHub Probot App [deployment steps](https://probot.github.io/docs/deployment/)  

#### Option 2: Container Deployment
Deploy using Docker:

1. Use the provided `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml`
2. Build and run the container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

#### Option 3: Serverless Deployment
Deploy to AWS Lambda or similar serverless platforms using the provided `serverless.yml` configuration. See [AWS deployment documentation](../AWS-README.md) for details.

#### Option 4: Kubernetes
Deploy to a Kubernetes cluster using the provided Helm charts in the `helm/safe-settings/` directory.

**Note:** Ensure your deployment environment has network access to GitHub APIs and can receive webhook events from GitHub.


### Build the UI

The Safe Settings dashboard includes a Next.js-based UI that must be compiled before deployment.

1. Navigate to the UI directory:
   ```bash
   cd safe-settings/ui/
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the Next.js application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

This creates an optimized production build of the dashboard UI that will be served by the Safe Settings application.

## Gettings Started

>**Note:** for the standard setup lets assume that Safe-Settings configuration on the Admin Config Repos (Spokes) are stored in `.github/`

These are the basic steps to setup the Enterprise-Level Safe-Settings, using **Hub-sync** support.

### ✅ Step 1: Register the App
**Register the Safe-Settings App** in your Enterprise (Enterprise App) or in your Organization.

For App "installation tragets" (Where can this GitHub App be installed?)
Choose ***Any account***

### ✅ Step 2: Install the App
**Install the Safe-Settings App** in any Organzation that you would like Safe-Settings to manage.

### ✅ Step 3: Create the 'Org-Level' Safe-Settings Admin Config Repo (Spokes)
Create the Org-Level Repo that is your dedicated Safe-Settings Config Repo and will hold all Safe-Settings configurations for the Org.

### ✅ Step 4: Create the 'Master' Safe-Settings Admin Config Repo (Hub)
Choose any Organization where the Safe-Settings App is installed and create a 'Master' Safe-Settings Admin Config Repo. 

The Repository requires a standard directory structure for storing the config data:
```bash
.github/
└─ safe-settings/
    ├── globals/
    │   └── manifest.yml
    └── organizations/
        ├── org1/
        │   └── ...yml
        └── org2/
            └── ...yml
```

Notes:
- The `manifest.yml` is a required file, that defines rules for syncing **Global** Safe-Settings configurations. We will address the content format later.
- `org1` and `org2` are just examples and should be replaced with the real names of the Orgs that you want to manage with the **Hub-Sync**.

### ✅ Step 5: Configure the 'Master' Safe-Settings Admin Config Repo (Hub)

The **Hub-Sync** feature supports two options
1. **Organization Sync:**
Any settings file in the `organizations/<ORG>` directory will be synced to the specific `<ORG>` (Spoke) Admin config Repo subfolder (eg.: <ORG>/.github/). Only updated files are sync'd to the ORG admin config Repo (spokes).
1. **Global Sync:** Any settings file in the `globals/` directory will be synced to the specific `<ORG>` (Spoke) Admin config Repo subfolder (eg.: <ORG>/.github/).

    :warning: The actual sync operation is based on the rules defined in the `globals/manifest.yml`. The rules provide fine grained control over the sync targets and sync strategy.

These two options only require that you provide the files you would like to sync, in the correct sub-directory.

#### ✅ Step 5.1: Configure the `manifest.yml` in the 'Master' Safe-Settings Admin Config Repo (Hub)

The `manifest.yml` defines the sync rules for global settings distribution.
- Sample `manifest.yml`

  ```
  rules:
    - name: global-defaults
      # specify the target ORG(s)
      targets: 
        - "*"
      files:
        - "*.yml"

      # mergeStrategy: merge | overwrite | preserve
      # --------------------------------------------
      # merge     = use a PR to sync files 
      # overwrite = sync all files to the target ORG(s) (no PR)
      mergeStrategy: merge

    - name: security-policies
      # specify the target ORG(s)
      targets: 
        - "acme-*"
        - "foo-bar"
      files:
        - settings.yml
      mergeStrategy: overwrite
      
      # optional toggle, default true
      # enabled: false 
  ```

### Example Rule Breakdown

```yaml
- name: global-defaults
  targets: 
    - "*"
  files:
    - "*.yml"
  mergeStrategy: merge
```
- **Purpose:** Sync all YAML files to all organizations, merging changes via PR.

```yaml
- name: security-policies
  targets: 
    - "acme-*"
    - "foo-bar"
  files:
    - settings.yml
  mergeStrategy: overwrite
  enabled: false
```

- **Purpose:** Overwrite `settings.yml` in specific organizations, but currently disabled.


### `manifest.yml` Reference

The `manifest.yml` file defines synchronization rules for Safe-Settings hub-and-spoke configuration management. Each rule specifies which organizations and files to target, and how to handle synchronization.

### Top-Level Structure

```yaml
rules:
  - name: <string>
    targets: [<string>, ...]
    files: [<string>, ...]
    mergeStrategy: <merge|overwrite|preserve>
    enabled: <true|false> # optional
    # ...additional fields as needed
```

1. Sync the `Hub Admin Repo` changes to a `Safe-Settings Admin Repo` in **the same ORG** as the Hub Admin Repo.

2. Sync the `Hub Admin changes` to a `Safe-Settings Admin Repo` in **a different ORG**. 

3. _`'Global'`_ `Hub Admin Repo` updates. 
Changes will `applied to all Organization`
